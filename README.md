# michaelfm1211's Stack Overflow Userscripts
Currently, this repo only has one userscript, which I use in conjuction with [Samuel Liew](https://github.com/samliew/SO-mod-userscripts)'s [Review Queue Helper](https://github.com/samliew/SO-mod-userscripts#review-queue-helper) and [SOMU Options](https://github.com/samliew/SO-mod-userscripts#somu-options) scripts. I also use [Makyen's Roomba Forecaster](https://github.com/makyen/StackExchange-userscripts#roomba-forecasterinstall).

These scripts should not be considered free of bugs. If you find a bug, open an issue and I will try to address it (or open a PR if you have a solution!). You can also open issues or PRs if you want to suggest a new feature.

### List of userscripts in this repo:
- [`moderation.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelfm1211/stackoverflow-userscripts/master/moderation.js): Adds various "fast-action" buttons to the question page UI, such as quick links to close/flag reasons and links to post common comments. This script should work and be helpful for users of all reputation levels.
